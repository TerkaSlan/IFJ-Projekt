And second line, also with some variable. E.g. a = 15
Third line - printing b variable: 3.14159265358979
And now more concat. Still in 1 print. Still the same print, concatenation of string and double 153.14159265358979
Also trying escape sequences. Tab 	, new line 
, backslash \ and quotation mark ". And now some nice chars, for example \100: @
